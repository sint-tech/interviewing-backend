### Merging changes to development
   After approving the PR, you must rebase your code with the **Development branch**, So you may do it on your local machine or the GitHub website.
 - For using the GitHub application check this [URL](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/squashing-commits-in-github-desktop)
 - Using CLI
  ```git
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout #branch name
git rebase development
git push --force
```

- Using Github, you will see a button called **Update your branch** just ensure to select rebase instead of merge
> [!WARNING]
> u may use the regular ``merge`` command when there are conflicts between the two branches (development, and your branch)

Now, once the `current branch` is ready for merging into the development. U should [squash](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash) the commits into development branch ðŸš€
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your changes are hotfixes, and need to be merged also on **production**.
> You have also to follow these steps
> ```git
> git checkout master
> git checkout -b #new-branch-from-master
> git cherry-pick #commit-hash #commit merged to development
> ```
